            Are you a life scientist interested in business or entrepreneurship? Do you wonder how
            game-changing decisions are made about our innovative discoveries once they leave the
            lab? Penn Biotech Group (PBG) and Penn Graduate Consulting Club (PGCC) will be hosting
            the first virtual Penn Healthcare Case Competition on November 7th. This event is meant
            to give graduate students (PhDs, JDs, MDs, masterâ€™s, etc) and postdocs an opportunity to
            solve a real healthcare problem in teams of 3-6 members. You will also be able to meet
            and engage with corporate leaders from top healthcare and biotechnology firms who will
            be helping as judges.
            </p>
          <p className="mt-8 text-2xl font-light text-left">
            All are welcome to apply to participate. No business experience is
            necessary. Cash prizes will be given with the first-place team receiving $2000! More
